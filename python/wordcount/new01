First-half goals from Danny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi were enough to give the Gunners their first Premier League victory in a month, and came as a welcome relief following their recent FA Cup and Champions League exits.
Arsenal remain well behind leaders Leicester, but at least they retain an interest in the title race going into April.
"The character of my players was questioned. We know if we don't win today we were out of it. I think it was a mental test for the side," said Wenger.
"I am not masochistic enough to consider us out. Mathematically we have a chance and a game in hand at home. We are not the flavour of the week, but if we don't believe, no one will do it for us.
"Even if the mind is sceptical, we have to give our best in every single game. We have to be humble and fight in every game like we did today then we never know.
"Of course we need some performances and some good results from the others. We cannot help that."
Wenger was impressed with 19-year-old Iwobi, the nephew of former Premier League star Jay-Jay Okocha, who opened his account for the club with a coolly-taken goal.
"He is an intelligent boy who loves football, is very passionate about the game, keen to learn and very humble as well," added Wenger.
"He is 19 years old and has been at our club since the age of eight. I took him in pre-season and I liked what he did. After that he improved very quickly. He did very well. I integrated him and played him."
